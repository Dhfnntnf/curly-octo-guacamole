Simple text based RPG game that I made when I was bored. 
When starting the game, make sure to run every code. The actual game is the last codeblock.
Basically, you go around exploring and trying to find food and weapons to fight enemies.
If there are any major issues/you complete the game, please inform me thks :)
It is in theory impossible to lose with perfect play, but it takes too long.
Works best on jupyter notebook
